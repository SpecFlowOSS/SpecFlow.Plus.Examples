# Excel Example
This example demonstrates the three usecases of using SpecFlow+ Excel.
* Defining full Features in Excel (Add Feature)
* Defining all examples in Excel (Subtract Feature)
* Defining only a part of the used examples in Excel (Multiply Feature)

Ofcourse it is als o possible to use non Excel Features alongside Excel Features (Divide Feature)
